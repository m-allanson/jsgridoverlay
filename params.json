{"name":"Jsgridoverlay","body":"### What is it?\r\nIt's a javascript script for quickly overlaying an image onto a page.  You can adjust the transparency if you like, which makes it handy for comparing a page to an existing layout.  Made out of plain old javascript so doesn't have any dependencies or require any other libraries.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\n\r\nInclude the following line at the bottom of your page:\r\n\r\n`<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://raw.github.com/m-allanson/jsgridoverlay/master/grid.js\"></script>`\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce installed, add an image like this:\r\n\r\n* Press `Ctrl + ;` to activate a blank overlay.\r\n* Drag an image from your computer and drop it on the blank overlay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen make adjustments with these shortcuts:\r\n\r\n* Toggle with `Ctrl + ;`\r\n* Adjust opacity with `Ctrl + [` and `Ctrl + ]`.\r\n\r\nPress `Ctrl + ;` to try it right now. (this is currently not true)\r\n\r\n### Where do I get it?\r\n\r\nRight here on GitHub: [https://github.com/m-allanson/jsgridoverlay](https://github.com/m-allanson/jsgridoverlay)\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nThis script is originally based on the jQuery plugin [jsgridoverlay](http://code.google.com/p/jsgridoverlay/), written by [jeddy3](https://github.com/jeddy3), [thegingerbloke](https://github.com/thegingerbloke) and [m-allanson](https://github.com/m-allanson)\r\n\r\nThis script is also a bit of an experiment, makes no attempt to support older browsers and has had minimal amounts of testing (unlike the original version linked above).  However any suggestions for improvements are welcome!","tagline":"A standalone javascript script to overlay an image onto a webpage.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
